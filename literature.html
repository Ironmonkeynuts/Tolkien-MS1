          <p>J.R.R. Tolkien's poetry is an integral part of his fictional worlds, particularly in The Lord of the Rings, The Hobbit, and The Silmarillion. His poems often reflect the mythic and legendary themes of his works, focusing on the beauty of nature, heroism, and melancholy. They also draw from various linguistic traditions, with many being written in Elvish, Old English, and other languages he invented.</p>
          <h5>Themes in Tolkien's Poetry:</h5>
            <p><strong><em>Myth and Legend: </em></strong>Tolkien's poetry is often set in the mythical past of Middle-earth, invoking ancient heroes, battles, and the rise and fall of civilizations.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Nature and the Passing of Time: </em></strong>Many poems express Tolkien's love of nature, with vivid descriptions of forests, rivers, and stars, as well as a recurring focus on the bittersweet passage of time.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Journeys and Adventure: </em></strong>As with his prose, much of his poetry revolves around quests, journeys, and exploration, capturing the essence of adventure.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Lament and Loss: </em></strong>A melancholy tone pervades much of his poetry, reflecting the decline of old ways, the fading of magic, and the loss of loved ones.</p>
            <p><strong><em>Song-like Structure: </em></strong>Many of Tolkien’s poems are meant to be songs, which is why music and verse often play an important role in his stories.</p>
          <h5>Notable Poems by Tolkien:</h5>
          <p><strong><em>"The Road Goes Ever On": </em></strong>A poem from The Lord of the Rings, this piece represents the theme of endless journeys and adventure. It is sung by both Bilbo and Frodo Baggins.</p>
          <p>"The Road goes ever on and on,<br>
            Down from the door where it began.<br>
            Now far ahead the Road has gone,<br>
            And I must follow, if I can…"</p>
          <p><strong><em>"Song of Durin": </em></strong>This poem from The Lord of the Rings celebrates the ancient Dwarf-lord Durin and his people. It is a nostalgic reflection on the lost greatness of the Dwarves.</p>
          <p>"The world was fair, the mountains tall,<br>
            In Elder Days before the fall<br>
            Of mighty kings in Nargothrond<br>
            And Gondolin, who now beyond<br>
            The Western Seas have passed away..."</p>
          <p><strong><em>"Lament for Boromir": </em></strong>This mournful poem is sung by Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli in honor of the fallen hero Boromir.</p>
            "Through Rohan over fen and field where the long grass grows,<br>
            The West Wind comes walking, and about the walls it goes."</p>
          <p><strong><em>"A Elbereth Gilthoniel": </em></strong>A hymn to Varda (Elbereth), queen of the stars, this Elvish poem is a prayer that captures the spiritual and otherworldly aspect of the Elves.</p>
          <p>"A Elbereth Gilthoniel,<br>
            silivren penna míriel<br>
            o menel aglar elenath!..."</p>
          <p><strong><em>"The Lay of Leithian": </em></strong>A long narrative poem that tells the tragic love story of Beren and Lúthien, two central characters in The Silmarillion. This epic poem captures love, loss, and the courage of two individuals against insurmountable odds.</p>
          <h5>Style and Influence</h5>
          <p>Tolkien’s poetry was influenced by ancient epics such as Beowulf, medieval ballads, and Norse mythology. His use of alliteration, meter, and rhyme often mirrors these older forms, grounding his invented world in a deep sense of history and tradition.
            In addition to the poems embedded within his stories, Tolkien also published a volume of his non-Middle-earth poetry titled The Adventures of Tom Bombadil (1962), which collects lighthearted verse about various creatures and events in his world.</p>

          <p>J.R.R. Tolkien was not only a renowned author but also a talented artist. His artwork is often linked to his famous literary works, particularly The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings series. Tolkien’s illustrations capture vivid landscapes, detailed maps, and his imagined world of Middle-earth, reflecting his deep love for nature and mythology.</p>
          <h5>Key Characteristics of Tolkien’s Artwork:</h5>
          <p><strong><em>Landscapes and Nature: </em></strong>Many of his illustrations depict forests, mountains, rivers, and mythical locations, emphasizing natural beauty and mystical environments.</p>
          <p><strong><em>Maps: </em></strong>Tolkien created highly detailed maps of Middle-earth, which serve as a visual aid for readers to follow the journeys of his characters. These maps are iconic and intricately designed.
          <p><strong><em></em>Architectural Elements: </em></strong>His work often includes ancient, detailed structures like towers, castles, and cities, adding to the world-building aspect of his stories.
          <p><strong><em>Watercolor and Ink: </em></strong>Tolkien’s art typically used watercolors or ink, giving his pieces a delicate and ethereal quality.
          <p><strong><em>Symbolism: </em></strong>His art, like his writing, often included symbolic and mythological elements, like runes, stars, and intricate patterns.
          <p>Tolkien’s artwork, while not as well-known as his writing, offers a glimpse into the visual imagination behind his legendary stories. Some of his most famous works include illustrations from The Hobbit, such as the cover featuring Smaug and the Lonely Mountain. His artistic style has a gentle, almost whimsical quality, yet with a sense of grandeur fitting for his epic tales.</p>
