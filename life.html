            <h3>Childhood</h3>
            <p>John Ronald Reuel Tolkien was born on January 3, 1892, in Bloemfontein, South Africa, to English parents. When he was just three years old, his mother brought him and his younger brother, Hilary, back to England. Their father had passed away shortly thereafter in South Africa, so the family settled in England. By the summer of 1896, Tolkien's mother had found a home for them in the small village of Sarehole, located just outside Birmingham.</p>
            <p>The Tolkien family lived in modest circumstances and later moved to Moseley, a suburb of Birmingham to the northwest of Sarehole. When Tolkien was 12, his mother passed away, leaving him and his brother to become wards of a Catholic priest. They subsequently lived with relatives and in boarding houses. The contrast between Tolkien's idyllic early years in the rural Sarehole and his more challenging adolescence in the industrial city of Birmingham would have a profound impact on his later works.

            <h3>School life and the TCBS</h3>
            <p>At the age of eight, Tolkien earned a scholarship to the prestigious King Edward VI School in Birmingham, prompting the family to relocate to the city for the rest of his schooling. There, he thrived in his studies, excelling in languages such as French, German, Latin, and Greek, and developed a deep interest in Old English, Middle English, and Gothic. Tragically, when Tolkien was twelve, his mother developed diabetes, and her health rapidly declined. As a recent convert to Catholicism, Mabel Tolkien arranged for Father Francis Morgan, a compassionate Catholic priest, to become the guardian of her sons. She passed away within the year, leaving Ronald and his younger brother Hilary orphaned. Despite this, Father Francis remained a constant presence in their lives, providing them with both emotional and financial support throughout his lifetime.</p>
            <p>At school, Tolkien connected with a group of like-minded friends: Geoffrey Smith, Chris Wiseman, and Rob Gilson, each excelling in literature, mathematics, and drawing, respectively. The group often met in the school library, where they would secretly brew tea and discuss their ideas. When they were caught and expelled from the library, they relocated to Barrows department store, where they continued their meetings and tea-drinking without interruption. This close-knit group eventually formed the Tea Club and Barrovian Society, or T.C.B.S. for short. Their bond was forged through a shared passion for creating something beautiful in the world. However, their dreams were soon overshadowed by the onset of war, which would profoundly impact their lives and ambitions.</p>

            <h3>University and Edith</h3>
            <p>Tolkien initially applied to study Classics (Literae Humaniores, also known as Greats) at Oxford and, after a second attempt, won a scholarship to Exeter College in 1911. During his first two years of relatively relaxed study, he was granted permission to switch from Classics to English, allowing him to focus on his burgeoning interest in Germanic philology, particularly Old Norse, Old English, and Middle English.</p>
            <p>In 1913, the same year he made this academic shift, Tolkien was reunited with Edith Bratt, a fellow orphan whom he had met while sharing lodgings in Birmingham. Initially, Tolkien’s guardian had attempted to end their budding romance, fearing it would distract Tolkien from his studies. He imposed a three-year ban on any contact between them. However, once Tolkien turned twenty-one and the restriction was lifted, he immediately reached out to Edith, and they became engaged within a week.</p>

            <h3>The Great War and the Lost Tales</h3>
            <p>The rekindling of his relationship with Edith Bratt gave Tolkien a renewed sense of purpose, leading him to apply himself more diligently to his studies. He graduated with first-class honors in June 1915 and quickly enlisted in the army, securing a commission in the Lancashire Fusiliers with hopes of joining the same battalion as his school friend Geoffrey Smith. After a year of training in Staffordshire and Yorkshire, he became a signalling officer.</p>
            <p>As the threat of war loomed, Tolkien and Edith married in March 1916. Just three months later, he was deployed to France to participate in the Somme offensive. There, he witnessed the brutal realities of trench warfare and the widespread devastation of life and land. Five months into his service, he was evacuated to England on a hospital ship suffering from trench fever, a recurring ailment that troubled him for the next two years. During this period, he spent considerable time in hospitals and on defensive duty along the east coast.</p>
            <p>It was during these tumultuous years that Tolkien began writing ‘The Lost Tales,’ a collection of heroic stories about Elves from an ancient era. These tales would later evolve into The Silmarillion, an epic chronicle of Elves, Men, and Gods, which would influence his later works, including The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. The proximity of death may have spurred his creative drive. By the war’s end, both Rob Gilson and Geoffrey Smith from the T.C.B.S., along with many of Tolkien’s university friends, had perished. Before his death, Geoffrey Smith had urged Tolkien to continue their shared ideals, saying, "May you say the things I have tried to say long after I am not there to say them, if such be my lot."</p>

            <h3>Oxford, the Inklings and the Ring</h3>
            <p>After the war, with a wife and young son to support, Tolkien returned to Oxford and took up a position as a lexicographer working on the Oxford English Dictionary. In 1920, he secured his first academic role as Reader in English Language at the University of Leeds, and four years later, he was promoted to professor. His scholarly contributions included the publication of Middle English Vocabulary in 1922, designed for students using Kenneth Sisam’s Fourteenth Century Verse and Prose, and his edition of the medieval romance Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, co-edited with Eric Gordon, which was published in 1925.</p>
            <p>That same year, Tolkien returned to Oxford as the Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon and a fellow of Pembroke College. Over the next two decades, he taught Old English, Old Norse, Gothic, and Germanic philology, supervised postgraduate research, and continued his own academic studies. His 1937 British Academy lecture, “Beowulf: The Monsters and the Critics,” was a seminal work that challenged and transformed longstanding critical perspectives on the Old English epic poem. Additionally, his 1939 lecture, “On Fairy-Stories,” delivered at St. Andrews, sought to define the nature of fantasy and later became recognized as a key justification for his own work in fantasy literature.</p>
            <p>At Oxford, Tolkien met C.S. Lewis, a fellow member of the English Faculty. They quickly discovered their mutual passion for northern myths and legends, often spending late nights discussing “the gods & giants & Asgard.” They were invited to join the Inklings, an undergraduate club that later disbanded. However, Tolkien and Lewis continued to use the name for a circle of friends who gathered in pubs or college rooms to read aloud their work, engage in discussions, and enjoy each other's company. The Inklings, particularly C.S. Lewis, played a pivotal role in encouraging Tolkien to complete his major works.</p>
            <p>In his spare time, Tolkien immersed himself in his legendarium, crafting extensive histories, creating languages, writing stories, and designing maps and landscapes. He also entertained his four children—John (born 1917), Michael (born 1920), Christopher (born 1924), and Priscilla (born 1929)—with original stories. Some of these stories were written down and illustrated, and one of them, The Hobbit, came to the attention of a publisher's assistant who urged Tolkien to submit it for publication. It was published by George Allen & Unwin in 1937, featuring Tolkien’s own illustrations, maps, and dust jacket design. The first print run sold out within three months, establishing the book as a beloved children’s classic.</p>
            <p>The success of The Hobbit prompted Tolkien’s publisher, Stanley Unwin, to request more stories about hobbits. Instead, Tolkien submitted excerpts from the unfinished The Silmarillion. These were rejected, leading Tolkien to begin work on a sequel to The Hobbit. What started as a children’s story evolved into an epic fantasy novel for adults, which took twelve years to complete. Tolkien later described it, somewhat ruefully, as a “monster: an immensely long, complex, rather bitter, and very terrifying romance, quite unfit for children.”</p>
            <p>This work, The Lord of the Rings, was both a sequel to The Hobbit and an extension of his unpublished legendarium, The Silmarillion. Tolkien’s deep connection between the works led him to propose that The Lord of the Rings be published alongside the still-unfinished Silmarillion. This idea was met with resistance from his publisher, and attempts to negotiate with rival publisher Collins also faltered. Three years later, Tolkien wrote to George Allen & Unwin, acknowledging the situation with the phrase, “better something than nothing.” Despite concerns over its length and potential readership, Rayner Unwin (son of Sir Stanley) believed in the work's value and decided to publish it, even at the risk of financial loss. The Lord of the Rings was released in three volumes between 1954 and 1955. Although critical reception was mixed, the book far exceeded both the publisher's and Tolkien's sales expectations, continuing to sell in large numbers and being translated into numerous languages.</p>

            <h3>Later life</h3>
            <p>In 1945, while still grappling with the completion of The Lord of the Rings, Tolkien was appointed Merton Professor of English Language and Literature at Oxford. This new role shifted his academic focus from Old English to Middle English, requiring him to prepare a completely new set of lectures and seminars on texts he hadn’t taught since 1925.</p>
            <p>That same year, Tolkien published Leaf by Niggle, a short allegorical story that mirrored his own anxieties about whether he would ever finish The Lord of the Rings. A few years later, he released another short story, Farmer Giles of Ham, a humorous tale illustrated by Pauline Baynes.</p>              
            <p>Tolkien retired in 1959 after thirty-four years at Oxford. In retirement, he aimed to complete The Silmarillion, a project he had been working on for over forty years and which was eagerly anticipated by his publisher and readers. However, the success of The Lord of the Rings brought its own demands: he was frequently engaged with fan mail, interviews, and public appearances. Additionally, he continued his academic work, culminating in the 1962 publication of his long-awaited edition of Ancrene Wisse, a medieval prose text. That same year, he also published The Adventures of Tom Bombadil, a collection of poems set in Middle-earth.</p>
            <p>In 1967, Tolkien published Smith of Wootton Major, a short fairy tale he described as “an old man’s book already weighted with the presage of ‘bereavement.’” The following year, he collaborated with composer Donald Swann to produce The Road Goes Ever On, a songbook that further explored the themes of his literary world.</p>
